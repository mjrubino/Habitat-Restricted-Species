# Habitat-Restricted-Species

The U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Project (GAP) mapped range and habitat for 1590 terrestrial vertebrate species throughout the conterminous US (CONUS), including 219 sub-species. There is a known relationship between the areal extent of a species' range and its habitat. That is, as range size increases, habitat area increases in a linear fashion. However, for some species, habitat area is much smaller than expected based on range size. These species may be potentially "habitat restricted". We were interested in exploring which species would be considered the most habitat restricted relative to their range size along with assessing their conservation status. We began by calculating the proportion of habitat within range by dividing total amount of predicted habitat area by range area. We then selected species whose percentage of habitat in range constitute the lowest five percent of values and examined their conservation status using NatureServe global rankings and the International Union for Conservation of Natureâ€™s (IUCN) threatened categories.
